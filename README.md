# BMW-OpenSource
All the Open Source Software provided by BMW for their i3

From -  https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2016/03/bmw-are-complying-with-the-gpl/ 

Earlier this month <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2016/03/bmw-and-the-gpl/">I accidentally kicked off a minor kerfuffle over whether BMW was respecting the GPL</a>.  Their i3 car contains a huge amount of Open Source Software and there was some confusion as to BMW's compliance with the licence terms.

I <a href="https://youtu.be/Kal-MjsNcFQ">took a look through the car's user interface</a> and, hidden away, was this email address.

Today I received this letter in the post:

With this ancient piece of spinning media :-)

That's 950MB of open source goodness!
